# GPU Shaders

This program uses the GLSL coding language alongside the three.js framework to create various shaders. Most of the implementation was done in the shaders folder, but some necessary setup was needed and can be found in the src folder. To run this program on a local host, Node modules must be properly installed. CD'ing into the gpu-shaders on command prompt, terminal, etc. and typing the command "npm install" should install dependencies. NOTE: this will only work after Node is installed on your local computer. After the dependencies are resolved, typing the command "npm run dev" should start up a local host.
